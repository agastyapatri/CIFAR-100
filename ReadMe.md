# CIFAR-100 Image Classification 
_This project aims at creating an image classification model that is trained on the CIFAR-100 dataset_

## About the dataset
The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 60000 32x32
colour images in 100 classes, with 600 images 
per class. There are 500 training images and 
100 testing images per class. There are 50000 
training images and 10000 test images. 
The 100 classes are grouped into 20 
superclasses. There are two labels per 
image - fine label (actual class) and coarse label
(superclass).
